The core of this competition is&nbsp;**AI + API automated trading only**.\nTo ensure fairness, any manual order placement or manual order modification during trading will be considered a violation.\nWe recommend that all participants keep their strategies&nbsp;**fully automated**&nbsp;for a safer experience.\n\n---\n\n**Q7: Can I trade any coin or trading pair?**\n\n**A7:**\nNot all trading pairs are allowed.\nThe organizer only permits the use of&nbsp;**designated perpetual contract pairs**&nbsp;(please refer to the announcement on the official event page).\nTrades using pairs outside the specified range will be excluded by the system, which may seriously affect your eligibility.\nFor detailed trading pairs, please refer to:\n👉&nbsp;[View Allowed Trading Pairs](https://www.weex.com/api-doc/ai/introduction/Rule)\n\n---\n\n## 📊&nbsp;**AI Log Submission**\n\n**Q8: Why do I need to submit an AI log? What should it include?**\n\n**A8:**\nThe&nbsp;**AI log**&nbsp;is required to confirm that your strategy is genuinely driven by AI, not manual operations.\nGenerally, the log should include:\n\n- Model version\n- Inputs/Outputs (prompts, model decisions, signals, etc.)\n- Reason for each order\n- Actual order execution records\nIt doesn’t need to be overly complex—just enough to demonstrate that \"this was an AI-driven decision.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔧&nbsp;**API Usage &amp; Technical Support**\n\n**Q9: Is there a rate limit on API calls? I’m worried my bot will get throttled.**\n\n**A9:**\nYes, each API endpoint has rate limits. However, in general, unless your strategy involves extremely high-frequency trading, most teams will not encounter issues.\nIf the limit is exceeded, the system will reject the request. You can simply wait a few seconds and try again.\n\n---\n\n**Q10: How should I correctly specify the symbol when placing API orders?**\n\n**A10:**\nThe&nbsp;**symbol**&nbsp;must use the exact value returned by the API, and case sensitivity matters.\nPlease do not manually guess or alter the format, as the API will return an error.\n\n---\n\n**Q11: Where can I find the API documentation?**\n\n**A11:**\nYou can view all instructions, including interface formats, parameter details, error codes, and sample calls, on the&nbsp;**WEEX official AI Trading API documentation page**.\nThis is one of the most important reference documents for the event, so we recommend bookmarking it.\n👉&nbsp;[API Documentation Link](https://www.weex.com/api-doc/ai/intro)\n\n---\n\n**Q12: How can I get help if I have technical issues?**\n\n**A12:**\nIf you encounter problems with API usage, AI log submission, or strategy setup, you can seek assistance through the following channels:\n\n1. **Official API Documentation**&nbsp;(most comprehensive technical reference)\n👉&nbsp;[FAQ &amp; Common Issues](https://www.weex.com/api-doc/ai/introduction/CommonProblem)\n2. **DoraHacks Community Discussion Section**&nbsp;(ideal for technical discussions and questions to other teams or the organizer)\n👉&nbsp;[Community Q&amp;A](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/weex-ai-trading-private/qa)\n3. **WEEX Official Support / Customer Service**\nFor account, permission, review, or non-technical inquiries, feel free to contact WEEX customer service.\nWe are always happy to help ensure your smooth participation in this event!\n\n---\n\n## 🏆&nbsp;**Rankings &amp; Rewards**\n\n**Q13: When will rankings and rewards be announced?**\n\n**A13:**\nTypically, after the event concludes, data will be reviewed to ensure all trades and AI logs comply with the rules before final results are announced.\nThe official announcement timeline will be based on updates from the WEEX website or DoraHacks. We recommend staying tuned for relevant notifications.\n\n---\n\n## 📋&nbsp;**Compliance &amp; Withdrawal**\n\n**Q14: If I fail KYC/KYB/UBO or regional compliance checks, will I lose eligibility?**\n\n**A14:**\nYes. If you fail the verification required by regional laws (e.g., KYC/KYB/sanction screening), the organizer cannot allow the account to continue participating or issue rewards.\nThis is a routine procedure—no need to worry, and support is available if needed.\n\n---\n\n**Q15: Can I withdraw from the event after joining?**\n\n**A15:**\nYou may stop trading at any time after registering, but registration itself cannot be canceled.\nHowever, stopping trading will not affect your account in any way, and there are no penalties.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖&nbsp;**Strategy &amp; Team**\n\n**Q16: Does the AI strategy need to be highly advanced? Can smaller teams join?**\n\n**A16:**\nNot at all!\nMany teams achieve good results using simple models, rule-based strategies, or lightweight AI training.\nThe focus of this event is on&nbsp;**\"genuinely AI-driven trading,\"**&nbsp;not on who has the largest or most complex model.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**&nbsp;Please refer to the latest official announcement for any updates to the event rules."}],"applied":false,"is_current_hacker_registered":false,"buidls_count":38,"applications_count":175,"organization":{"id":11727,"name":"WEEX LABs","logo":"https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/19a5282bb8220e75b1655f7430996eb7.png"},"description":"# **AI Wars : WEEX Alpha Awakens**\n\nWelcome to the future of AI-powered trading!
