This program is focused exclusively on game titles; corporate infrastructure should be reported via the Corporate Security Program.

We encourage careful, good‑faith research and concise reports with reproducible steps and the minimal evidence required to show impact. Wherever possible, test on isolated environments or use disposable/test accounts — do not interfere with live matches or other players’ experiences. Extracting or exposing player personal data will not be tolerated, and do not publish findings publicly until they are remediated or approved for disclosure.

Prohibited activities include social engineering, physical intrusion, creating or distributing cheats or bypasses for anti‑cheat systems, manipulating live economies to harm players, or any actions that materially disrupt gameplay or services.

When reporting, provide clear reproduction steps, affected platform/version, PoC where safe, and any relevant logs or captures. Our Security team will acknowledge submissions, investigate promptly, keep reporters informed, and offer recognition consistent with program policies.

To facilitate easier bug reproduction, we ask that a hash or version of the game being exploited be included in the report. Additionally, in the PoC source code, if hardcoded Virtual Addresses are used, include a comment specifying the corresponding Relative Virtual Addresses and offsets of the manipulated functions/objects.

To submit a report, please use Intigriti so we can review and remediate quickly.</div><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-1.5 rounded-full px-3 bg-grey-100 text-grey-500 py-1.5"><p class="text-xs/none font-semibold">Bug bounty program</p></div><div class="flex items-center gap-x-1.5 rounded-full px-3 bg-grey-100 text-grey-500 py-[4.5px] pl-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="h-3.5 w-auto flex-none"><path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.667" d="M12.5 2h2.7c1.68 0 2.52 0 3.162.327a3 3 0 0 1 1.311 1.311C20 4.28 20 5.12 20 6.8v10.4c0 1.68 0 2.52-.327 3.162a3 3 0 0 1-1.311 1.311C17.72 22 16.88 22 15.2 22H8.8c-1.68 0-2.52 0-3.162-.327a3 3 0 0 1-1.311-1.311C4 19.72 4 18.88 4 17.2v-.7M16 13h-4.5M16 9h-3.5m3.5 8H8m-2-7V4.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 1 3 0V10a3 3 0 1 1-6 0V6"></path></svg><p class="text-xs/none font-semibold">Application Required</p></div></div></div></div><div class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-x-4 gap-y-2 p-6"><a href="https://app.intigriti.com/programs/ubisoft/ubisoftgamesecbbp"><span class="group relative inline-flex items-center justify-center place-self-start text-left tracking-[0.009rem] transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out gap-x-2 text-base/none font-bold hover:text-primary text-blue-500 py-0!">View program<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="mt-0.5 size-4 flex-none"><path fill="currentColor" d="M15 8A7 7 0 1 1 1 8a7 7 0 0 1 14 0M6.647 4.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706L9.794 8l-3.147 3.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706.5.5 0 0 0 .706 0l3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0 0-.706l-3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.706 0" opacity="0.4"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M15 8A7 7 0 1 1 1 8a7 7 0 0 1 14 0M0 8a8 8 0 1 0 16 0A8 8 0 0 0 0 8m7.353 3.853 3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0 0-.706l-3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.706 0 .5.5 0 0 0 0 .706L9.794 8l-3.147 3.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706.5.5 0 0 0 .706 0"></path></svg></span></a><p class="text-primary text-right text-base font-bold tracking-wide">Up to<!-- --> <!-- -->€2,500</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col justify-between divide-y divide-neutral-300 rounded-[5px] bg-white shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]"><div class="grid flex-1 content-start divide-y divide-neutral-300"><div class="grid items-start gap-y-4 p-6 pb-4"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-3"><div class="flex size-14 flex-none items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-[5px]"><img alt="Ubisoft Corporate Security BBP" loading="lazy" width="56" height="56" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" src="https://bff-public.intigriti.com/file/public_bucket_d8861aa7-c79a-4ef3-b031-ec524039283e-a90479ce-9858-481a-aa28-73e64fcd4122"/></div><h4 class="font-heading text-primary text-xl/[1.3] font-semibold tracking-wide wrap-anywhere">Ubisoft Corporate Security BBP</h4></div><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-3 gap-y-2"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-1.5 rounded-full px-3 bg-transparent text-blue-600 ring-1 ring-blue-200 ring-inset py-1.5"><p class="text-xs/none font-semibold">Media and Entertainment</p></div></div></div><div class="grid gap-y-4 p-6 pt-4"><div class="line-clamp-4 text-base tracking-wide wrap-anywhere text-neutral-400">The Ubisoft Corporate Security Program maintains a trusted, public channel for reporting security issues that affect Ubisoft’s corporate assets — for example, internet‑facing services, corporate web apps and APIs, partner/employee portals, official desktop and mobile applications, and related cloud/storage/CDN infrastructure. Our aim is to work with the security community to find and fix vulnerabilities before they impact employees, partners, customers, or corporate data.

We welcome responsible, non‑disruptive testing and clear reports that include concise, reproducible steps and only the evidence necessary to demonstrate impact. Do not perform actions that harm availability, privacy, or other users; avoid extracting large data sets or accessing accounts you do not own. Do not attempt social engineering, physical intrusion, destructive testing (including DoS/DDoS), or any activity that could violate laws or program rules.

When submitting an issue, include enough context and a proof‑of‑concept to enable replication while minimizing exposure of sensitive data. Our Security team will acknowledge submissions, triage them promptly, communicate status updates, and provide recognition in accordance with program guidelines.

To report a vulnerability, please submit via Intigriti so our team can investigate and remediate the issue quickly.

Note: This program covers corporate assets only.

conversations, right on the website. With Qualified, our customers can leverage an AI SDR (sales development representative) to ask qualification questions to website visitors, capture leads or book sales meetings; then fast-track hot prospects, open opportunities, and target accounts to live sales conversations.
The result is creating more sales meetings and more pipeline. Qualified is purpose-built for companies that run on Salesforce, and is on the
Salesforce AppExchange (passing the Salesforce ISV Security Review). The Qualified offering includes chat (live and AI), meetings booking, offers, email, forms, smart buttons, and signals.

A 5-min product overview is available here: qualified.com/ai-sdr?play=piper-aug and a full overview of our product is available here: https://www.qualified.com/piper-demo-day#

The Qualified app has two main components, widgets that run on our customer&#x27;s websites and allow our customers to interact with their website visitors, and an admin console that is used to configure chatbot and AI SDR experiences, form experiences, offers, routing, etc. The admin console is also used by chat users to interact with customers on their website directly.

The &quot;widget&quot; is the Javascript a company installs to their website. &quot;Visitors&quot; to the website see experiences configured by admins and can talk to reps (either live or AI) that are logged into the &quot;console&quot; and set to available. We&#x27;ve set up a test website at https://team-ojwa63madn5nq72oaosk5wi6kgg5cslcbues6dq.qualified-private-test.com/?s=0 that loads the qualified.js widget snippet for the test company. Please note, the test website itself is out of scope for the purposes of our bounty program, the widget however is in scope.

The &quot;console&quot; is what the reps and/or the site admin login to. Available for testers at https://app.qualified-dev.com/live

Our application runs on Ruby on Rails backend, postgres database, ClickHouse database, react front end utilizing graphql, rest and websockets.</div><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-2"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-1.5 rounded-full px-3 bg-grey-100 text-grey-500 py-1.5"><p class="text-xs/none font-semibold">Responsible disclosure</p></div></div></div></div><div class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-x-4 gap-y-2 p-6"><a href="https://app.intigriti.com/programs/qualified/qualifiedresponsibledisclosureprogram"><span class="group relative inline-flex items-center justify-center place-self-start text-left tracking-[0.009rem] transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out gap-x-2 text-base/none font-bold hover:text-primary text-blue-500 py-0!">View program<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="mt-0.5 size-4 flex-none"><path fill="currentColor" d="M15 8A7 7 0 1 1 1 8a7 7 0 0 1 14 0M6.647 4.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706L9.794 8l-3.147 3.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706.5.5 0 0 0 .706 0l3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0 0-.706l-3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.706 0" opacity="0.4"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M15 8A7 7 0 1 1 1 8a7 7 0 0 1 14 0M0 8a8 8 0 1 0 16 0A8 8 0 0 0 0 8m7.353 3.853 3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0 0-.706l-3.5-3.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.706 0 .5.5 0 0 0 0 .706L9.794 8l-3.147 3.147a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .706.5.5 0 0 0 .706 0"></path></svg></span></a></div></div><div class="flex flex-col justify-between divide-y divide-neutral-300 rounded-[5px] bg-white shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]"><div class="grid flex-1 content-start divide-y divide-neutral-300"><div class="grid items-start gap-y-4 p-6 pb-4"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-3"><div class="flex size-14 flex-none items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-[5px]"><img alt="Dropbox Bug Bounty" loading="lazy" width="56" height="56" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" src="https://bff-public.intigriti.com/file/public_bucket_ba7d49c3-9caa-410f-b8c6-4f0263c55139-7f835cb1-cbbe-4359-a947-2112c202a471"/></div><h4 class="font-heading text-primary text-xl/[1.3] font-semibold tracking-wide wrap-anywhere">Dropbox Bug Bounty</h4></div><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-x-3 gap-y-2"><div class="flex items-center gap-x-1.5 rounded-full px-3 bg-transparent text-blue-600 ring-1 ring-blue-200 ring-inset py-1.5"><p class="text-xs/none font-semibold">Software</p></div></div></div><div class="grid gap-y-4 p-6 pt-4"><div class="line-clamp-4 text-base tracking-wide wrap-anywhere text-neutral-400">Welcome to the Dropbox Bug Bounty program — where your curiosity helps keep millions of users safe.
